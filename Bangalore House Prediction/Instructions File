Go through the powerpoint presentation attached to the parent folder before going through the code.

The analysis of Bangalore House Price Prediction is divided into three stages:

Stage I : In this analysis and Model trianing is done without : 
          (a) Outlier Treatment.
          (b) Column standardization.
          (c) Feature Engineering.
          (d) Multi-collinearity check.


Stage II(a) : In this analysis and Model training is done with : 
              (a) Outlier Treatment - Trimming
              (b) Column standardization.
              (c) Feature Engineering.
              (d) Multi-collinearity check. 
          
Stage II(b) : In this analysis and Model training is done with : 
              (a) Outlier Treatment - Capping
              (b) Column standardization.
              (c) Feature Engineering.
              (d) Multi-collinearity check.    
              
              
Stage III FinalModel : In this analysis and Model training is done with : 
                      (a) No Outlier Treatment
                      (b) Column standardization.
                      (c) Feature Engineering.
                      (d) Multi-collinearity check.   
                      
HyperParameter Tuning using Grid Search CV of the best model (RandomForestRegressor) is done at the end.
