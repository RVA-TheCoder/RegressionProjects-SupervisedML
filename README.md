# RegressionProjects-SupervisedML
Regression analysis is being done using various supervised ML algorithms like Multiple Linear Regression, SVR, KNeighbors-Regressor ,Decision-Tree Regressor , Random-Forest Regressor with hyperparameter Tuning


# For Bangalore House Prediction Project :
Go through the powerpoint presentation attached to the parent folder before going through the code.

The analysis of Bangalore House Price Prediction is divided into three stages:

Stage I : In this analysis and Model trianing is done without : (a) Outlier Treatment. (b) Column standardization. (c) Feature Engineering. (d) Multi-collinearity check.

Stage II(a) : In this analysis and Model training is done with : (a) Outlier Treatment - Trimming (b) Column standardization. (c) Feature Engineering. (d) Multi-collinearity check.

Stage II(b) : In this analysis and Model training is done with : (a) Outlier Treatment - Capping (b) Column standardization. (c) Feature Engineering. (d) Multi-collinearity check.

Stage III FinalModel : In this analysis and Model training is done with : (a) No Outlier Treatment (b) Column standardization. (c) Feature Engineering. (d) Multi-collinearity check.

HyperParameter Tuning using Grid Search CV of the best model (RandomForestRegressor) is done at the end.
